I began my coding journey as a self-taught computer science student at the age of 13, with a huge passion for learning everything I could about the world of programming. It all started with the desire to become a vigilante hacker like Mr. Robot and to develop my own AGI, like in Person of Interest. Eat, sleep, and practice: I voluntarily stayed in this loop for a long time until I landed my first job as a Front-End Developer after finishing high school and enrolling in one of the best universities in Angola, studying Computer Engineering. Currently, I am on my way to becoming a software engineer and achieving some of my childhood dreams.
